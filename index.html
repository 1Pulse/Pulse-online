       "...To explore this, I envision a tool—a guide that helps people navigate government, 
        from their neighborhoods to the highest levels, to give everyone a voice. This idea led 
        to 1Pulse: a free communication system to connect all neighborhood watches, where 
        everyone can be heard. Managed by the people, 1Pulse would ensure transparency and 
        accountability at every level, empowering us to build community, peace, and trust.
        Our constitution guides us: laws govern us, but people—real, everyday people—bring 
        these laws to life..."

        "In this book we intend to stimulate healthy conversations
        The City of Joburg operates as a substructure with various 
        departments, each represented by a distinct logo. These logos are the 
        city’s face to the people, covering services from the Johannesburg 
        Roads Agency (JRA) to City Power. I have, embarrassingly, too 
        many crime stories to tell about my South Africa, and I feel we are becoming too 
        comfortable with crime as a nation. My neighborhood watch is central Johannesburg, 
        and I know you have yours too. Let’s connect them—but first, let’s learn about our 
        power as the people."
